        <div class="intro">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 22.5px;">Dear STEM Ed students,</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 22.5px;">I am Logan. I personally welcome you to the MEd STEM Education Program at
                HKU. As the program coordinator, I work with my colleagues to foster an open, inclusive, and
                intellectually stimulating environment where you can get your hands dirty, keep your minds running, and
                start your soul searching. Below are some suggestions that I consolidated based on my prior experience
                teaching in this program. Please note that I am not an administrator or a tutor (我不是辅导员), therefore I do
                not have the administrative level information such as course registration link or date, graduation date,
                holiday schedule, certification letter, student visa, etc. Nor do I intervene in your personal
                conflicts, or romantic relationships (I enjoy listening to gossip though). I have an opinion on almost
                everything, but you should only trust those from my professional domains.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 22.5px;">Please join this <strong>Discord server</strong>: <a
                    href="https://discord.gg/F5QE4HdD" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/F5QE4HdD</a>. You can ask
                questions in the <em>general</em> channel, so that everyone will see the questions and answers. I will
                make programme related announcements here. I will make class-specific announcements via class-specific
                channels.</p>
            <p>Please <strong>introduce yourself in your Moodel profile</strong>. Put a clear headshot photo of yours.
                This will help the instructors know about you and remember your name. As I will explain in the
                <strong>Class Participation</strong> below, the instructors and teaching assistants need to remember
                your name in order to grade your class participation.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        <p>We believe science is a collective meaning making and an ongoing negotiation. Enlightenment
                            is a hard-fought liberation from a brain built for simplicity. Teaching is to sustain human
                            future. Technology should be human-centered. Given this, the quality of our (I mean both
                            mine and yours) work should reflect HKU Education's position in the top of the world.
                            Conversely, we do not believe in, and consider it an abuse to, wielding science, technology
                            or teaching as an exercise of power over the powerless. Most of our curriculum at the STEM
                            Education program will make sense to you if you corroborate how we teach to this statement
                            of our beliefs.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        <p>Here are some things you should have started practicing and keep practicing now (August
                            2025).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong><em>Your English</em></strong>. More specifically, your oral communication in
                                English. Writing is probably easier given the existing proofreading tools. You do not
                                have to speak beautiful English with perfect grammar, but you need to be able to get
                                ideas across given limited time. Exercise daily for 30 minutes by reciting a short
                                paragraph of a college-level text. My suggestion is simply: 1) read aloud and recite a
                                paragraph of recent news, 2) practice telling a news story or your life story to a real
                                or imagined friend, record it, transcribe it, and improve it a few rounds.</li>
                            <li><strong><em>Your Cantonese</em></strong>. If you cannot speak Cantonese, I strongly
                                suggest that you start learning it right away. It is important to respect and enjoy the
                                culture of the land that you are trespassing. Some of the courses will require you to
                                interact with teachers and students in the local schools, in which cases, Cantonese can
                                help you build trust (can find jobs).</li>
                            <li><strong><em>Your artistic skills and tastes</em></strong>. When we talk about STEAM
                                education, the art teachers are intimidated by the STEM part and the STEM teachers are
                                nervous about art. It really doesn't have to be this way. Draw something on Procreate
                                using your tablet once every two days, follow a tutorial on YouTube or Bilibili, and
                                take a look at David Hockney's paintings (or any other artists) once in a while. There
                                will be multiple occasions that your artistic skills will come to use in class or in
                                assignments.</li>
                            <li><strong><em>Your storytelling skills</em></strong>. Observe and practice storytelling
                                often. Do not saturate your mind with the fast-food gratifying narratives or the
                                mainstream propaganda. Listen to The Moth on podcast or TED Talks on YouTube. No matter
                                when you are presenting or writing a paper, you are always telling a story.</li>

                        <p><strong>AI tool</strong>: <em>Google Gemini</em>. The reason I suggest this is because it is
                            technically free for students till the end of 2026. So it is perfect for your use. But the
                            free student promotion has expired now, therefore, if you have not registered for an
                            account, you need to buy from second hand sellers. The price is very cheap (because these
                            sellers registered the account for free themselves). I am not going to suggest where to buy,
                            except for a hint to search on Taobao or Xiaohongshu. We will use Gemini on multiple
                            occasions.</p>
                        <p><strong>VPN</strong>: to use Gemini in Hong Kong, you need VPN. Buy one online. If your VPN
                            is slow, your AI will get stuck and become forgetful. I will not tell you where to buy. You
                            do the research.</p>
                        <p><strong>Discord</strong>: register a Discord account, we will use it in and off class. In
                            class, it is useful to share files. Off class, it is useful for Q&A. If you are in Mainland,
                            you need VPN to log in to Discord.</p>
                        <p><strong>Google Drive</strong>: You should already have a Google Drive if you have a Google
                            Gemini. Or you can register for a Google Drive independent of your Gemini account (suit
                            you). When your file submission is too big for Moodle or Discord, you will upload your files
                            to Google Drive and share the link. We've tried other options, so far Google Drive has the
                            largest space and easiest for collaboration.</p>
                        <p><strong>Notetaking: Obsidian or Notion</strong>. These are free notetaking apps. In Obsidian,
                            you can dump your ideas freely without thinking of the format and layout. In fact, I drafted
                            this Orientation page in Obsidian. In Notion, you get more advanced templates, which is
                            useful when you organize your curriculum designs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Data analysis: to use R</strong> for data analysis, you need to download R (the
                            language), and RStudio (the editor for you to write codes). Alternative to RStudio, you can
                            use Visual Studio Code. We may need Kiro to borrow help from AI for data analysis. Kiro is
                            free at this moment. It probably will soon start charging for monthly fees for extensive
                            use, but it will keep offering a free account for moderate use which will be sufficient for
                            your data analysis exercise. The advantage of Kiro is it does not ban HK from Claude-4 (so
                            far). So, download it now. It probably will ask you to join the waiting list, then join asap
                            (I don't know how long the waiting will be).</p>
                        <p><strong>Others</strong>: there are other tools that you can register when you need them, such
                            as Github, Canva, Miro, Lovart, Coze, Poe, Pictory, Runway and Telegram. Or you can register
                            them now and try them out.</p>
                        <p>For class, most of the free versions will be sufficient. If you wish to buy for Pro accounts
                            for extended use, it's your own decision and your own wallet.</p>
                        <p>All of these being said, do not be confined and controlled by your tools. I have noticed
                            considerable drop in the quality of students' assignments as AI becomes more prevalent.</p>

                                participate by doing, speaking, and sharing. In may courses, class engagement is counted
                                towards your grades. For example, in my class, we usually have 3-4 teaching assistants
                                counting who speaks up and who is browsing Xiaohongshu.</li>
                            <li>Introvert is not an excuse for not speaking up in a class. There is hardly any
                                non-introvert in academia. Your personality should not be the reason that you fail to
                                perform in a professional manner. If you wish to make a living as a teacher, a
                                researcher, a STEM curriculum developer, do the job, own the moment, and lose yourself.

                                feedback on your initial ideas, and real-world project engagement. You are all expected

                                you need to be absent for a longer period of time, you will be advised to pause your
                                study and come back again next year. Traveling conflict is not considered a valid excuse

                        <p>Team work is a common and necessary form of in-class or homework exercise. You are expected
                            to engage in teamwork as adult and professionals. Team work is not a simple division of
                            labor. For example, most of the presentations that segments each section to an individual is
                            a subpar presentation. To work as a team, you need trust, openness, synergy and also
                            diplomatic skills to manage different opinions and working styles. Each person brings in
                            their own perspective, expertise and humor to the team. Your collaboration will last not
                            just for a semester or a year, you will be surprised to realise that how much you will keep
                            collaborating and helping each other after you graduate.</p>
                        <p>The team size may vary from assignment to assignment and from class to class. You should be
                            ready to swiftly switch to different team formations as the task and size changes.
                            Sometimes, the instructor will randomly assign team. Therefore, it is not only wise but also
                            healthy to make friends with all classmates because you don't know who you will team up with
                            one day. You are expected to social as professional adults, not as teenagers.</p>
                        <p>I strongly suggest that part-time and full-time students team up together. You will help each
                            other in so many different ways. You can at least help each other with Cantonese and
                            Mandarine.</p>
                        <p>It is nearly impossible for the instructor to jurisdict or intervene the conflict in a
                            teamwork. Please be aware that you will be in the same cohort for three semesters sharing 5
                            core courses.</p>

                            course outline or assignment instruction. If you are not sure about the AI policy, ask the

                            actions. If you only use AI to proofread your finished work, it is impossible to have an AI
                            index above 10%. If you let AI to generate big chunks of text, such as prompting to AI

                    <p><strong><em>8001</em></strong> is a hybrid course for an overview of research methods to warm you
                        up for your capstone. Simply attending to this course and doing the homework are not enough to
                        make you capstone ready. It is a starter to get you familiar with the terminologies, so that you
                        can do our own diligence at your own time. This course has a zoom lecture part and a in-person
                        tutorial part. Zoom lecture will give you an introduction of the classic work and definition.
                        The tutorial (taught by my and my TAs) will try to land these abstract concepts to a STEM Ed
                        specific context.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>8859</em></strong> Provide an overarching introduction to the theoretical frameworks
                        in STEM education. This is going to be useful for your capstone frameworks, but to find the most
                        appropriate framework for you capstone, you need to read much more literature beyond this
                        course. This course will get you started.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>8860 (1A)</em></strong> is taught by Paco Chan and Me. Paco is a PhD student and a
                        lecturer from HKUST. Paco is the primary instructor, and I will be the support. We will try out
                        a variety of technologies. Each will be useful for your tasks in the spring and summer
                        semesters. Please note that 8860 has two versions. 1A is for STEM Ed students, and 1B is for
                        everybody else. You have to enrol in 1A.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>8896</em></strong> is taught by Muhammad Ali and Prof. Gary Wong. Ali is a PhD
                        student with many years of experience teaching computational thinking. This course will pay
                        particular attention on the pedagogy, not merely the technology.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>8895</em></strong> is taught by me. This course will blend STEM with different
                        interdisciplinary context in each session. It has probably the heaviest workload among all
                        courses. Be prepared to have some hard fun.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>8896</em></strong> is taught by Calvin Lo and me. We will consider the whole class as
                        a design firm. And we will design for some real-world clients. It will be action packed and you
                        need to engage in field research.</p>

                    <p>There are two capstone types you can choose from: research paper or professional portfolio.
                        Research typically involves empirical data. The data can be numerical or non-numerical, the
                        sample size may vary. There is not a rule of thumb for what kind of data or how much data you
                        should aim for. It all depends on the question you wish to solve. A misconceptions about
                        research project is that one has to do fancy statistics. You don't have to. The art of research
                        is in its design, people do complicated statistically to amend limitations in their research
                        design. Plenty of SEM analysis fall into the category of data fishing, not recommended.</p>

                    <p>Professional portfolio is to report something you designed. This is usually a curriculum, a class
                        session, or a product. A solid professional portfolio almost alway report real-world testing and
                        feedback from target users to demonstrate usability. Thus, professional portfolio deals with
                        data as well.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the easier way to decide between research paper and professional portfolio is to consider
                        how might it be helpful for your next step. If you wish to do more research after this master's
                        degree, do a research project on a topic/field that you wish to pursuit in the long run. If you
                        want to be a practitioner, do a professional portfolio so you can show it to your future
                        employers your innovative ideas.</p>

                    <p>The best capstone project may blends the two types--design an innovative curriculum and
                        experiment it in a rigorous way.</p>

                    <p>My advise is, 1) do something you could not do before, 2) do something that is so exciting to you
                        that you won't feel down even if you are lonely in this journey, and 3) do something that is
                        satisfying that even if you retire from STEM education immediately after you graduate, you would
                        still feel proud.</p>

                    <p>The four core advisors for STEM Ed program are: myself, Prof. Gary Wong, Prof. Lukas Liu, and Dr.
                        Alex Tse. Each advisor has limited vacancy, usually ~ 5-7 students. Gary is most interested in
                        computational thinking and AI; Lukas is most interested in AI, games, and learning sciences;
                        Alex is most interested in assessment and HK specific contexts, I do a bit of everything, and as
                        the coordinator, I do not have the luxury to pick, so I will accept all students. Please read
                        each professor's profile from HKU webpage and see who is a good match to your interest. You can
                        reach out to the professors and nail an early agreement on the advisor-ship. If you want to work
                        with a professor other than these four, you need to reach out to that professor directly to seek
                        agreement. Please inform me once you reach an advisor agreement with anyone. You can start
                        reaching out to potential advisors now, we usually will settle this by mid October.</p>

                    <p>Your advisor is the person who grade your capstone, so you should prioritise your advisor's
                        suggestions on your capstone.</p>

                    <p>Your advisor will not ask you for a progress report. It is your responsibility to keep your work
                        updated to your advisor. They usually need at least a week to process your requests, read your
                        work or answer to your questions.</p>
